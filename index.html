          <p class="body-text">I thought I came to study (but the campus studied me) is about a student who slowly begins to realize something unsettling. University is not just about classes or deadlines. It is about the spaces you move through every day. At first, those spaces seem ordinary: a dorm room, a humming laundry machine, a flickering hallway light, the soft glow of a laptop screen at three in the morning. But over time, the student senses something else. The campus is not just a backdrop. It is paying attention. It watches. It regulates. It does not ask anything directly, but somehow, you begin to change. Your thoughts. Your rhythms. Even your silences.</p>
    
          
        </div>
        <div class="about-right">
          <p class="body-text">The film drifts quietly through these places. There are no fast cuts. No loud sounds. It invites you to slow down and feel. To notice. To ask: what is really shaping me here? This is not a scary story. There are no monsters. No villains. Just architecture. Routine. Quiet pressure.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Shot entirely on location at NYU Abu Dhabi, using real campus spaces, the film tries to capture what it actually feels like to live on campus. Being busy but still stuck. Being watched, but not by cameras. Just by the space itself. The building. The air. The system. The film is short. Only ninety seconds. But it might stay with you longer.</p>

              <p><b>The Surface:</b> Sunlight filters through tall grass near a tree. Still, quiet.</p>
              <p><b>What the Campus Was Doing:</b> This isn't just landscaping—it's a mood regulator. The soft movement of grass under light slows your pace without asking.</p>

              <p><b>What the Campus Was Doing:</b> Even in silence, the campus reminds you it's awake. Every surface reflects the fact that your body is still here, still working.</p>

              <p><b>What the Campus Was Doing:</b> Movement here is mechanical. It's meant to move you fast—no time for thoughts. Just up or down.</p>

              <p><b>What the Campus Was Doing:</b> This is instinct—not decorum. The campus includes life that doesn't follow the rules of efficiency or order.</p>
