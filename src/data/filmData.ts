    whatYouSaw: 'A long, sterile hallway stretching toward nowhere, with fluorescent lights that flicker just slightly too often.',
    whatCampusWasDoing: 'The hallway is designed to create the illusion of being observed. Notice how the light creates shadows that follow you from multiple angles.',

    whatYouSaw: 'Empty chairs arranged in perfect symmetry. Books no one is reading. The sound of pages turning.',
    whatCampusWasDoing: 'Time behaves differently here. The clocks run at 0.98x normal speed—just slow enough to be imperceptible but enough to keep you longer than you planned.',
    theme: 'Time as a Trap',
    missedDetail: 'The same student appears in the background three times, wearing three slightly different outfits.',

    whatYouSaw: 'Hundreds of conversations happening at once, blending into white noise. Food being consumed mechanically.',
    whatCampusWasDoing: 'The acoustics are designed to amplify certain frequencies—making private conversations public while administrative announcements fade into the background.',
    theme: 'Institutional Haunting',
    missedDetail: 'Every tray contains the exact same arrangement of food, down to the placement of silverware.',

    whatYouSaw: 'Washing machines spinning in hypnotic rhythm. The sound of water being forced through fabric.',
    whatCampusWasDoing: 'This is one of the few places where students can be alone with their thoughts, so the institution ensures it\'s as uncomfortable as possible. Notice the harsh lighting, the metallic surfaces that amplify sound.',
    theme: 'Resistance Through Stillness',
    missedDetail: 'One washing machine never stops, even when unplugged.',
